/*You'll be trying out a bunch of string methods. Do the following, outputting the changed string to an alert after each change that is made to a string so I can see that it worked.  
Create a new form named 'strings'.
Create a variable named quoteString and put this string in it: 
"Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again this time more intelligently."

Using a string method, change the text in quoteString to all upper case and save it in a new variable named upperCaseString. Use this format for your output to the console:

               Upper case string is: XXXXX
Create a new variable named authorString and put this text in it. 

               "- Henry Ford"
Then create a new variable completeString that holds a new string created by  adding the author (in authorString) on the end of the string in quoteString. Then create a new variable named 'found' that outputs a message as to whether the string "Henry" was in the string in 'completeString' or not. Output the message in this format to the console: 

              Henry was in the quote string
              OR
              Henry was NOT in the quote string

Now create a new string variable named secondQuote and put this string in it: 
"Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work. - Stephen King"

Using a string method, change the text in secondQuote to all lower case and save it in a new variable named lowerCaseString. Use this format for your output to the console:

             Lower case string is: XXXXX

Get a number from the user using 'prompt'. Then add 10 to the number and output it to the console in the format:

          The number X + 10 is ANSWER. (where X is the user number and answer is the number + 10).

Hint: Remember, prompts bring all user data into the program as a string....  so what do you have to do so you can use this string in a math operation like 'add'? */

let quoteString = "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again this time more intelligently."

upperCaseString = quoteString.toUpperCase()

console.log(`Upper case string is: ${upperCaseString}.`)

let authorString = "- Henry Ford"

let completeString= (quoteString + authorString)

let found = ""

value = completeString.includes("Henry")

if (value == true) {
  found = "Henry was in the quote string"
  console.log(found)
} else {
   found = " Henry was NOT in the quote string"
  console.log(found)
}

let secondQuote = "Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work. - Stephen King"

let lowerCaseString = secondQuote.toLowerCase()

console.log(`Lower case string is: ${lowerCaseString}`)

let userNumber = prompt("Enter a number")

let userInteger = parseInt(userNumber)

let total = userInteger + 10

console.log("The number " + userNumber + " + 10 is " + total +  ".")
